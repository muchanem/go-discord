/* Defines the actual action the bot takes

* the command does when it is run. This can be as simple as printing a string
* or embed to discord or even be a wrapper for a massive series of functions
* for your discord-based RPG.
*
* Parameters:
* - session (*discordgo.Session) The bot session, in case you need to pull data
*	from about discord itself to complete your task
* - session (*discordgo.Message) The entire message that triggered the command
*	this includes the prefix and command itself. You will have to parse out
*	flags and clean the input.
*
* NOTE: THIS DOES NOT RETURN ERRORS. YOU MUST HANDLE ERRORS.

* - message (type *discordgo.Message) | the author's id is extracted from this.
*
* Returns:
* - st (type *discordgo.Guild) | The guild the message was found in
* - err (type error)           | If an error was encountered during the process
*	This error is an SEP (someone else's problem).

/* # Checks if user can run a command
* This is a more detailed check to see if a user has the role perms to run a
* command. It is a very complicated wrapper for what would in theory be a
* very simple task.
*
* Do not confuse this with commandHandler's "canTriggerBot()". This function
* determines if a user has a specific role, that just checks if the command is
* run in the correct channel and if they aren't blacklisted.
*
* Parameters:
* - s (type *discordgo.Session) The current running discord session,
*     (discordgo needs that always apparently)
* - message (type *discordgo.Message) | the author's id is extracted from this.
* - role (type string) | the role **ID NUMBER!!** that needs to be matched.
*
* Returns:
* - bool | if the role was found or not, if an error was found it will be false
* - err  | if an error was encountered during the process.
*     To be handled by not-the-function
*
* User's whose roles are considered "admin" by the json config file return an
* automatic true regardless if they have the role listed. Hence if you want to
* lock off a command to only "admin" users, provide an empty string
